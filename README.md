Geospatial Point Aggregation Using H3

This Python script aggregates geolocated point data into approximately 1 kmÂ² hexagonal zones using the H3 geospatial indexing system. It is useful for spatial clustering, density analysis, and visualizing concentrations of point-based geodata.

---

âœ… Features
- Reads geospatial point data from an Excel file
- Cleans and validates latitude/longitude input
- Assigns each coordinate to an H3 cell (resolution 8 â‰ˆ 1 kmÂ²)
- Counts how many points fall within each hex cell
- Computes the centroid of each H3 cell
- Saves the result to a new Excel file

---

ðŸ“¦ Requirements
To run the script, install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas h3 openpyxl

ðŸš€ Usage

Clone or download this repository.

Run the script in a terminal or IDE:

bash
Copy
Edit
python h3_density_mapper.py
You will be prompted to:

Enter the path to your input Excel file

Provide the desired output path for the results

Input Format
Your Excel file should include columns named:

latitude
longitude

These can be in any order, and column names are matched case-insensitively with leading/trailing spaces removed.

ðŸ—‚ Output
The output Excel file will contain:

h3_cell: the H3 hexagon ID (resolution 8)

count: the number of points in that hexagon

centroid_lat: latitude of the hexagon center

centroid_lng: longitude of the hexagon center

ðŸ§­ Customization
You can change the H3 resolution (currently set to 8) to adjust the size of the aggregation cells. See H3 Resolution Guide for reference.
